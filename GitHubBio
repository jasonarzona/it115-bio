Hello everyone, my name is Jason Arjona. I was borna and raised in a little island called Guam. 
I recently moved to Seattle to try and get into the tech industry.
When I first moved here, I took some online courses on my own time on Coursera.
I was able to finish and get a certificate for the Google IT Support course. 
Most of my time is taken up by school and work but
on my free time I like to go for walks in the park while listening to music and watching the sunset.
